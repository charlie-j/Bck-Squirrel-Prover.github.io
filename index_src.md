The **Squirrel Prover** is a proof assistant for protocols. It is based on first-order logic and provides guarantees in the computational model.

# Getting started

A 13 minutes introduction to the basic concepts and core ideas of the **Squirrel Prover** can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-s_lGe44EM).

A [README](https://github.com/squirrel-prover/squirrel-prover/#readme) provides installation instructions.

A [tutorial](tutorial.html) and some commented [examples](examples.html) allow to start discovering it.
