# Past-Events

## Cyber 2022 in Nancy

Slides are available [here](nancy22.pdf).

The school featured a Squirrel tutorial, consisting of a series of
exercises of increasing difficulty, covering:

* the basic logical constructs and tactics manipulating them,
* several cryptographic assumptions,
* accessibility properties (authentication, injective authentication),
* equivalence properties (unlinkability),
* stateful protocol, and
* protocol composition.

As support material to go through the exercises, we provide
syntax documentation [here](doc-nancy.html).
The full documentation can be found [here](https://squirrel-prover.github.io/documentation/).

The files of the tutorial are now part of the official Squirrel
distribution, under the `examples/tutorial/` directory.
They are also accessible directly below:

- [0-logic](files/0-logic.sp)
- [1-crypto-hash](files/1-crypto-hash.sp)
- [2-crypto-enc](files/2-crypto-enc.sp)
- [3-hash-lock-auth](files/3-hash-lock-auth.sp)
- [4-hash-lock-unlink](files/4-hash-lock-unlink.sp)
- [5-stateful](files/5-stateful.sp)
- [6-key-establishment](files/6-key-establishment.sp)

Those, again, are available on our online version [here](https://squirrel-prover.github.io/jsquirrel/)
